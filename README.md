### ``Hi there`` 👋 
#### ``I'm Daniel, a software engineer and technical writer.``

``This is my personal code space. Feel comfortable to look around the public repos. If there's anything you find that is of interest to you and you'd like to talk about, feel free to contact me..``


- 🌱 I’m currently learning threejs, you might see some stuff about that among my repos (or not).
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on opensource projects that are related to making software engineering logic easier for software developers in a way that doesn't impose on the developers' design philosophy.
