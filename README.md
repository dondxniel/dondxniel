### ``Hi there`` 👋 
#### ``I'm Daniel, a software engineer.``

``This is my personal code space. Feel comfortable to look around the public repos. If there's anything you find that is of interest to you and you'd like to talk about, feel free to contact me..``

- 🌱 I’m currently learning go, you might see some stuff about that among my public repos (or not - for private projects).
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on opensource projects that are related to making software engineering logic easier for software developers in a way that doesn't impose on the developers' design philosophy.
- 👨🏾‍💻 I'm also interested in projects that involve or use USSD technology, to any degree, as I am looking to increase my knowledge base on it's intricasies and hidden advantages over traditional communication protocols.
