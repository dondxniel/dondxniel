### ``Hi there`` 👋

- 🌱 I’m currently learning threejs, you might see some stuff about that among my repos (or not).
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on opensource projects that are related to making software engineering logic easier for software developers in a way that doesn't impose on the developers' design philosophy.
- 👨🏾‍💻 I'm also interested in projects that involve or use USSD technology, to any degree, as I am looking to increase my knowledge base on it's intricasies and hidden advantages over traditional communication protocols.
